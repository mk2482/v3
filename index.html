                <h2>About SOAR Bio</h2>
                <p style="padding-top: 7px; padding-bottom: 34px;">U.S. Biotech is bloated.&nbsp; Biotech innovation in the U.S. is slow and expensive.&nbsp; We&apos;ve lost our way.&nbsp; </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 7px; padding-bottom: 34px;">In contrast, biotech innovation in China is fast, inexpensive, and <i>here now</i><span>.&nbsp; </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 7px; padding-bottom: 34px;">To stay competitive, we need to go back to our entrepreneurial roots and train the next generation of biotech leaders to do more with less.&nbsp; But scrappy biotech founder/CEOs can&apos;t be trained in classrooms, just like a new doctor can&apos;t learn to do heart surgery from books alone.&nbsp; What&apos;s required is a true apprenticeship - hands-on skill transfer through daily mentorship.&nbsp; </p>
                <p style="padding-top: 7px; padding-bottom: 34px;">And there&apos;s no better place to do that than the&nbsp;Greater Washington area, home to storied institutions that produce abundant technology and talent.&nbsp; Greater Washington has all the ingredients to train the next generation of biotech leaders that can build great companies that compete - and win - globally.</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 7px; padding-bottom: 34px;">At SOAR Bio, we build great companies from scratch by pairing seasoned entrepreneurs with entrepreneurial fellows. Our mission is to translate the region&rsquo;s most promising discoveries to commercial therapies, and we do that by translating the region&apos;s most promising talent to leaders.</p>

          ventures through acquisitions and public listings.&nbsp; We don&apos;t subscribe blindly to the standard U.S. biotech mantra &quot;raise money when you can get it, not when you need it&quot;.&nbsp; Having sufficient capital is important, but in U.S. biotech circles, we tend to spend a lot of time talking about raising capital, and little time talking about how best to spend it.&nbsp; That&apos;s the other Biotech Golden Rule: &quot;If you take care of the pennies, the dollars will take care of themselves.&quot;.&nbsp; We think the best companies are built when raising capital is not an end to itself, but balanced with how best to spend it.</p>
