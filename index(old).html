                <h2>About SOAR Bio</h2>
                <p style="padding-top: 7px; padding-bottom: 34px;">Greater Washington is rich in science but poor in start-ups. The District&ndash;Maryland&ndash;Virginia (DMV) region attracts more than $4.3bn a year in NIH funding,  but only 3% of locally generated biotech intellectual property (IP) becomes a start-up company  and fewer still reach patients as approved therapeutics. The missing ingredient is not technology or capital but seasoned founder‚Äëmanagers who can turn early science into capital‚Äëefficient firms and see them through to a successful outcome.</p>
                <p style="padding-top: 7px; padding-bottom: 34px;">
SOAR Bio is DMV&rsquo;s first therapeutics‚Äëfocused venture studio.  Our mission is to translate the region&rsquo;s most promising discoveries to commercial therapies.</p>
